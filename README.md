## 💻 **Installation** <a name="#installation"></a>
Install `Node.js` and `npm`, to your local machine by running `node install -y`, to fully experience this application. Using `npm`, install the `inquirer` package by entering into the terminal: `npm i inquirer@ 6.3.1`.

<hr/>

## 🚀 **Usage** <a name="#usage"></a>
First, `fork` the repository into your personal GitHub workspace and `clone` the project — this is so that you have your own personal copy of the application. Open the application to explore the project files if you wish. To start the application, open a `terminal` and locate to the `root` directory. Then, type `node index js`. A series of prompts will appear instantly to allow you to enter your answers in. If successful, the current `README.md` will be created, and updated with every iteration.
